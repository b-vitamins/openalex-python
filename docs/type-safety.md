# Type Safety

This client provides comprehensive type safety through Pydantic models:

```python
from openalex import Works

# Full IDE autocomplete and type checking
work = Works()["W2741809807"]
print(work.title)  # str
print(work.publication_year)  # int | None
print(work.authorships[0].author.display_name)  # str

# Type errors caught at development time
# work.invalid_field  # <-- IDE/mypy error

# Nested objects are fully typed
for authorship in work.authorships:  # list[Authorship]
    if authorship.author:  # DehydratedAuthor | None
        print(authorship.author.orcid)  # str | None
```

## Benefits

1. **IDE Autocomplete** - All fields are discoverable
2. **Type Checking** - Catch errors before runtime
3. **Documentation** - Types serve as documentation
4. **Validation** - Pydantic validates API responses

## Computed Properties

Models include helpful computed properties:

```python
work = Works()["W2741809807"]

# Automatic abstract conversion
print(work.abstract)  # Converts inverted index to text

# Helper methods
print(work.has_references())  # bool
print(work.open_access.is_oa)  # bool

# Year-specific citations
citations_2023 = work.citations_in_year(2023)  # int
```

This type safety is a major advantage over dictionary-based approaches.
