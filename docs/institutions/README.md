# üè´ Institutions

Institutions are universities and other organizations to which authors claim affiliations. OpenAlex indexes about 109,000 institutions. You can access institutions in the Python client like this:

```python
from openalex import Institutions

# Create a query builder for institutions
institutions_query = Institutions()

# Execute the query to get the first page of results (25 institutions by default)
first_page = institutions_query.get()

print(f"Total institutions in OpenAlex: {first_page.meta.count:,}")  # ~109,000
print(f"Institutions returned in this page: {len(first_page.results)}")  # 25
```

The [Canonical External ID](../../how-to-use-the-api/get-single-entities/#canonical-external-ids) for institutions is the ROR ID. All institutions in OpenAlex have ROR IDs.

Our information about institutions comes from metadata found in Crossref, PubMed, ROR, MAG, and publisher websites. In order to link institutions to works, we parse every affiliation listed by every author. These affiliation strings can be quite messy, so we've trained an algorithm to interpret them and extract the actual institutions with reasonably high reliability.

For a simple example: we will treat both "MIT, Boston, USA" and "Massachusetts Institute of Technology" as the same institution (https://ror.org/042nb2s44).

Institutions are linked to works via the `works.authorships` property.

Most papers use raw strings to enumerate author affiliations (eg "Univ. of Florida, Gainesville FL"). Parsing these to determine the actual institution the author is talking about is nontrivial; you can find more information about how we do it, as well as downloading code, models, and test sets, [here on GitHub](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-institution-parsing).

## Important: Understanding Query Results

When you use `Institutions()`, you're creating a **query builder**, not fetching data. The data is only retrieved when you call:
- `.get()` - Returns one page of results (25-200 items)
- `.paginate()` - Returns an iterator for all results
- `.group_by(...).get()` - Returns aggregated counts, not individual institutions

With ~109,000 institutions total, it's feasible to fetch all institutions if needed (unlike works with 240M+ records).
